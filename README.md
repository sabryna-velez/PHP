# PHP
PHP Projects and files
I completed these PHP Assignments during my CGT 356 Web Programming, Development And Data Integration class at Purdue. 
In that class I learned how to connect a database, create a working login page, as well as how to insert, update, and delete information throughout those pages. 
I learned how to keep my code organized, as well as how to solve my problems in a unique and timley manner.
